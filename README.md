# State-of-charge-estimation


In this work using Extended Kalman Filter (state estimator for non-linear models) the state of charge an EV battery is estimated. From the obtained results, the driving range available for the EV with the available SoC is also predicted.

Abstract
=========
Deployment of large number of electric vehicles has been planned in the coming years for improving fuel economy and to meet emission standards. Government of India plans to introduce subsidy/tax rebate/incentive for EV users who utilizes electrical energy in an optimal manner. The major anxiety of people opting for EV is low driving range and the accessibility of connection to the utility grid. If a facility is available to monitor battery parameters to compute power requirements and to list out nearest charging stations, it will help EV users a lot. 


This paper proposes an intelligent monitoring and predicting scheme for battery state of charge, driving range and other useful information. The scheme is validated with MATLAB/Simulink simulation results.
